# PCA

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables. PCA is the most widely used tool in exploratory data analysis and in machine learning for predictive models. Moreover, PCA is an unsupervised statistical technique used to examine the interrelations among a set of variables. It is also known as a general factor analysis where regression determines a line of best fit.

In short, PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms a set of features in a dataset into a smaller number of features called principal components while at the same time trying to retain as much information in the original dataset as possible
